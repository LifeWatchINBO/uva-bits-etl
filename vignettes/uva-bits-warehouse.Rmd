# UvA-BiTS Warehouse

## Intro

At the [Research Institute for Nature and Forest](http://www.inbo.be) (INBO) we are tracking birds using the [UvA-BiTS system](http://www.uva-bits.nl/) as part of the [LifeWatch project](http://www.lifewatch.inbo.be). As tracking data volume grows quicker than human observation data (what we usually work with), we were in need for a data store that contains the data cleaned and enriched tracking data in a system that is optimized for querying these *large-ish* data sets. Something like a data warehouse. This R package contains code to extract the data from the UvA-BiTS virtual lab, clean and enrich it, and load it in the data warehouse.
