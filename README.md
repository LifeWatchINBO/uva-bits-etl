# uvabits

> âœ‹ This package is not ready for use! It was previously called `BirdTrackingEtl` and used exclusively to process UvA-BiTS data for INBO researchers (see [release](https://github.com/inbo/uvabits/releases/tag/bt-etl) and [vignette](vignettes/bird-tracking-etl.Rmd) for that version). We are now expanding its functionality for more general use by UvA-BiTS users. Want to contribute? Check out our [contributing guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

uvabits provides an R interface to the [UvA-BiTS database](http://www.uva-bits.nl/), which stores bird movement data collected with UvA-BiTS GPS trackers. The package provides functionality to download data and metadata, calculate some metrics, and load the data into a  query-optimized SQLite database for local analysis. It also allows to download the data in a format that can easily be uploaded to [Movebank](https://www.movebank.org/), a free online database for animal tracking data.
